# 💬 Conversation Improvements

## What Changed

The Ghost Butler now handles unknown commands much more gracefully and conversationally!

### Before ❌
```
*The spirits whisper uncertainly* Your words echo through the void, 
but I cannot discern their meaning. Try these commands:
• "Ghost, dim the lights"
• "Ghost, show me ascii art"
```

**Problem:** Felt like an error message, not a conversation

### After ✅
```
*Tilts spectral head curiously* Hmm, "your command"... 
An intriguing request, though I'm not quite sure how to assist 
with that particular matter.

Perhaps I could interest you in:
• Adjusting the lights? (try "dim the lights")
• Showing you some spooky ASCII art? (try "show me a pumpkin")
• Telling you a ghost story or poem?
• Giving you a proper fright? (try "scare me")

What would you prefer, mortal?
```

**Better:** Conversational, helpful, stays in character

## Examples

### Unknown Command: "make me coffee"
Response might be:
```
*Adjusts spectral monocle* "make me coffee", you say? 
A most unusual request! While I don't have a specific service 
for that, I am quite skilled at:

💡 Lighting control - "dim the lights" or "brighten the lights"
🎃 ASCII artistry - "show me a pumpkin" or "show me a skull"
📖 Storytelling - "tell me a story" or "write a poem"
😱 Frightening - "scare me" (if you dare!)
⏰ Timekeeping - "what time is it?"

How may I serve you instead?
```

### Short Input: "hey"
Response might be:
```
*Phantom candelabra flickers* Welcome! Your Ghost Butler is here. 
I can help with lights, stories, poems, ASCII art, or just have 
a chat. What would you like to explore?
```
